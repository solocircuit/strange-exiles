description: This spiritual classic, originally published in 1666, is in some
  respects similar to Augustine's Confessions. Bunyan traces his own spiritual
  pilgrimage from youth, through several crises, to his conversion. Through many
  trials, difficulties, temptations, and sorrows, he comes to rely solely on
  Christ for his every need. Written in prison, it served as an epistle of
  encouragement to his congregation. Bunyan's moving story of his conversion has
  become spiritual food for countless others.
