## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Strangers & Exiles.

We want to create and share Bible based educational contentÂ that can be enjoyedÂ by all followers of Christ.

However, with the current climate we find ourselvesÂ in we are trying to create a system thatÂ is relatively censorship-resistant andÂ one that can stand up against deplatforming.

Therefore, we are attempting to create this site using simple web technologies for easy deployment on any platform and if necessary used for quick replication. This site might look complex but is nothing more than a basic text document, which in theory would help should the site every be taken down since it can be uploaded anywhere easily **(even using IPFS if needed)**.

We are wanting to preserve the rich written history of Christian voices that have come and gone across itsÂ two millennia of existence,Â people who believed that Jesus was and is the only way to heaven in this life and the next.

##### Their stories, lives, and testimonies are precious before GodÂ and should not be forgotten and should not be erased.

The resources listed here will be invaluable to anyone's Christian journey and greatly needed for the times ahead.

Â It's just as the Lord Jesus told us in 2Â Timothy 3:1Â 

> #### But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come.

Let usÂ not forget the promise given to us in John 16:33

> #### I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. You will have suffering in this world. Be courageous! I have conquered the world.

This world will try erasing all evidence of the truth, relegating it be forgotten to the dust bin of history.Â Â 

> #### Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists, except for an endless present in which the Party is always right.

> #### The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became the truth.

However, we have a promise,Â that God has given usÂ for a hope and future. Hebrews 12:22-24 & Revelation 3:12

> #### Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God (the heavenly Jerusalem), to myriads of angels, a festive gathering, to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been writtenÂ in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediatorÂ of a new covenant. . .

> #### The one who conquers I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my Godâ€”the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my Godâ€”and my new name.
